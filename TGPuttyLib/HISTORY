---------------------
Build 7 - 23 Dec 2019

Uses #ifdefs to remove the memory allocation callback features, which are only used for debugging.
This reinstates binary compatibility with older builds.

---------------------
Build 6 - 23 Dec 2019

This update fixes more memory leaks and rare AVs. It also adds the optional memory checking code
used to detect any leaks. This code is not active by default and removed by the linker.

---------------------
Build 5 - 21 Dec 2019

This update fixes memory and event handle leaks. The event handle leak in winsftp.c is actually
still in the original PuTTY 0.73. I will try to submit the fix to them. The memory leaks were
in DLL exclusive code (well except for one that doesn't affect us anyway).

---------------------
Build 4 - 3 Dec 2019

This update fixes incorrect random permissions on uploaded files, which could happen when 
files were uploaded from a Delphi stream (like the Delphi component does it, even if you 
use the UploadFile method with a file path). 
The bug itself was in the DLL.

Also includes minor improvements in some of the Pascal source code files.

---------------------
Build 3 - 1 Dec 2019

Minor Demo improvements, including Unicode support for local filenames when downloading.

---------------------
