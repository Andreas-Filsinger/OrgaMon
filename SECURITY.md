# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

OrgaMon should be used in a well known, good understood local Network. OrgaMon will not open Port if not
requested by the config. Do not redirect Internet to OrgaMons Open Port for local XMLRPC for example. The
community do not like snakeoil, only real improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Fix it and report directly via eMail to an active deleloper. Their Customers will be asked to update from cargobay
because of security. Updates are made until a deadline, make now a pull request - never before the danger is removed.
